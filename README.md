### About The Project

Our lapses in memory might include things like,
 How do we find our way around? Why do I always get lost while my friend never does? Why does people's sense of direction vary so widely in general? "Why did I come in this room?“ or "Oh ... what's his name?“ or "Where did I put my keys?"
- To confirm their initial hypothesis, We have Designed an App that compares the navigational performance on male and female volunteers of all ages and It will detect People’s Risk of Alzheimer’s/Dementia.

### Inspiration

Some facts:

Dementia/Alzheimer is a syndrome, usually of a chronic or progressive nature, caused by a variety of brain illnesses that affect memory, thinking, behaviour and ability to perform everyday activities.

- The number of people living with dementia worldwide is currently estimated at 50 million and will almost triple by 2050.
- A new case of Demntia/Alzheimer is diagnosedevery 3 seconds 
- The High Cost of the disease will challenge health systems to deal with the predicted Future increase of cases.

A diagnosis may well provide long-awaited answers for a failing memory, communication problems and changes in behaviour.

An early diagnosis opens the door to future care and treatment. It helps people to plan ahead while they are still able to make important decisions on their care and support needs and on financial and legal matters. It also helps them and their families to receive practical information, advice and guidance as they face new challenges

### Impact of a diagnosis
A major report on the benefits of early diagnosis shows that a diagnosis is often greeted with severe shock, with feelings of disbelief, anger, loss and grief (ADI 2011). However, a diagnosis is often regarded by those with dementia and family members as a ‘positive event’, particularly when the initial shock has worn off. Critically, the response to a diagnosis depends on how a person with dementia is told about it – and the level of support that is available to them and their families after diagnosis.

It is therefore important for the person with dementia and their family to receive the dementia diagnosis in a positive way, with time made available to answer any questions and for support and reassurance to be provided. This is more likely to lead to the individual feeling more in control and empowered to make decisions.

### Benefits of diagnosis
An early diagnosis – and access to the right services and support – can help people take control of their condition, plan for the future and live well with dementia. It will help to eliminate the possibility of other, potentially treatable, conditions with dementia-like symptoms being responsible for memory, communication, behaviour and other problems.

It can help people with dementia to have access to relevant information, resources and support, make the most of their abilities and potentially benefit from drug and non-drug treatments available. An early diagnosis gives someone the chance to explain to family and friends the changes happening in their life. On a practical level, a person with dementia may have the opportunity to review their financial situation and discuss with family or legal experts making arrangements for a lasting power of attorney or an advance decision (see Making decisions).

There is strong evidence that an early diagnosis helps someone with dementia to continue to live independently in their own home for longer. This helps to avoid early or unnecessary admission to a care home or hospital, enhancing the quality of life for people with dementia and carers and providing substantial savings on long-term care costs. Drug and non-drug treatment can be more effective the earlier someone is diagnosed.
