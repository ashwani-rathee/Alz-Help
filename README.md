### About The Project

Our lapses in memory might include things like,
 How do we find our way around? Why do I always get lost while my friend never does? Why does people's sense of direction vary so widely in general? "Why did I come in this room?“ or "Oh ... what's his name?“ or "Where did I put my keys?"
- To confirm their initial hypothesis, We have Designed an App that compares the navigational performance on male and female volunteers of all ages and It will detect People’s Risk of Alzheimer’s/Dementia.

### Inspiration

Some facts:

Dementia/Alzheimer is a syndrome, usually of a chronic or progressive nature, caused by a variety of brain illnesses that affect memory, thinking, behaviour and ability to perform everyday activities.

- The number of people living with dementia worldwide is currently estimated at 50 million and will almost triple by 2050.
- A new case of Demntia/Alzheimer is diagnosedevery 3 seconds 
- The High Cost of the disease will challenge health systems to deal with the predicted Future increase of cases.

#A diagnosis may well provide long-awaited answers for a failing memory, communication problems and changes in behaviour.
#An early diagnosis opens the door to future care and treatment. It helps people to plan ahead while they are still able to make important decisions on their care and support needs and on financial and legal matters. It also helps them and their families to receive practical information, advice and guidance as they face new challenges
