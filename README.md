<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
### About The Project

Our lapses in memory might include things like,
 How do we find our way around? Why do I always get lost while my friend never does? Why does people's sense of direction vary so widely in general? "Why did I come in this room?“ or "Oh ... what's his name?“ or "Where did I put my keys?"
- To confirm their initial hypothesis, We have Designed an App that compares the navigational performance on male and female volunteers of all ages and It will detect People’s Risk of Alzheimer’s/Dementia.

### Motivation
